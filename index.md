## About Me

I'm a final-year Ph.D. student working at MIT CSAIL with Professor Manya Ghobadi. My work focuses on computer networking and machine learning systems to push the boundaries of scalability and efficiency. I enjoy designing high-performance networking solutions and exploring novel network architectures for GPU clusters. You'll probably find me sipping coffee or doing some heavy lifting in the gym when I'm not in the lab.

**I am currently on the faculty job market for positions starting in 2026-2027.**
