## About Me
I'm a final-year Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL's [Network and Mobile Systems (NMS)](https://nms-r1.csail.mit.edu/) research group, working with Professor [Manya Ghobadi](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ghobadi/). Before MIT, I earned my B.S. in computer science (honors), advised by Professor [Alex C. Snoeren](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~snoeren/), and my B.S. in physics from UC San Diego. I design adaptive network systems for machine learning workloads, focusing on network architectures, host-adaptation of reconfigurable networks, and programmable datapaths. When I'm not in the lab, I'm usually <span class="tooltip">making coffee<span class="tooltiptext">Favoring natural-process Ethiopian coffee beans and Aeropress.<br>
